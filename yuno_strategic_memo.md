# Strategic Memo: PIX Parcelado — Build vs. Partner Decision
**To:** CEO, Yuno
**From:** Strategy Analyst
**Date:** February 2026
**Subject:** Recommendation on PIX Parcelado — Brazil Gaming Vertical

---

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation: Modified Partnership (Option C)**

Partner with PixFlow immediately — but renegotiate the exclusivity terms — while preserving a clear decision point at month 12 to build native integration if market validation supports it.

This approach retains at-risk merchants in weeks, avoids a $320K capital commitment under regulatory uncertainty, and generates real market data before making an irreversible build decision. The financial case for building today is weak on incremental PIX Parcelado revenue alone; but the financial case for doing nothing is even weaker — the three gaming merchants represent $270K/year in existing Yuno revenue that is actively at risk.

---

## 1. Reframing the Problem

The case as presented evaluates the build decision on a narrow basis: incremental PIX Parcelado revenue at Yuno's 0.15% take rate generates only $36K/year on the estimated $24M volume shift — a 9-year payback on $320K investment.

This framing is misleading in two ways:

**The denominator is wrong.** The relevant financial comparison is not "new PIX Parcelado revenue" versus "build cost." It is:

> **[Revenue protected + Revenue gained] vs. [Build cost + Ongoing maintenance]**

The three gaming merchants collectively generate **$270K/year in existing Yuno fees** ($180M × 0.15%). One of them has begun a technical evaluation with OrchestraPay. Merchant churn is not hypothetical — it is in progress.

**The opportunity ceiling is wrong.** The analysis anchors on the 15–25% credit card shift from just three merchants. But Yuno's Brazil portfolio includes $340M in annual TPV across gaming, travel, and electronics — verticals with real PIX Parcelado demand. The correct question is not "what do these three merchants shift?" but "what does PIX Parcelado capture across Yuno's relevant Brazil book over 3 years?"

## 2. Financial Model

### 2.1 Scenario Framework

Three scenarios based on PIX Parcelado adoption across Yuno's Brazil portfolio:

| Scenario | Description | PIX Parcelado Volume (Yuno, Year 1) | Year 3 Projection |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Low** | Only 3 gaming merchants adopt; regulation limits growth | $19M | $25M |
| **Mid** | Gaming + travel merchants; PIX Parcelado matures | $50M | $85M |
| **High** | Broad adoption across relevant verticals ($340M book) | $85M | $150M |

**Assumptions:**
- Year 1 = 12 months post-launch (accounts for 6-month build timeline in Option A)
- Growth rates: Low 15% YoY, Mid 30% YoY, High 40% YoY
- Merchant churn risk if PIX Parcelado unavailable: 40% probability of losing 1 of 3 gaming merchants in 12 months

### 2.2 Option A: Build Native

| | Low | Mid | High |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Upfront cost** | $320K | $320K | $320K |
| **Annual maintenance** | $40K | $40K | $40K |
| **Year 1 revenue (0.15% take rate)** | $28.5K | $75K | $127.5K |
| **Year 3 revenue** | $37.5K | $127.5K | $225K |
| **3-Year cumulative revenue** | $94K | $278K | $578K |
| **3-Year net (vs. cost of $440K)** | **-$346K** | **-$162K** | **+$138K** |
| **Payback period** | Never (at current take rate) | 8–9 years | ~3.5 years |

**Merchant retention value (Option A):**
Build resolves the retention risk immediately upon launch (month 6). If we assume 40% probability of losing 1 merchant (worth $90K/year in fees) without action:
- Expected loss over 12 months without PIX Parcelado: $90K × 0.4 = **$36K expected cost of inaction in Year 1 alone**
- Expected loss over 3 years (churn compounds): **~$120K–$180K in protected revenue at risk**

### 2.3 Option B: Partner with PixFlow (As Proposed)

| | Low | Mid | High |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Upfront cost** | ~$0 | ~$0 | ~$0 |
| **Effective Yuno take rate** | 0.324% | 0.324% | 0.324% |
| **Year 1 revenue** | $61.6K | $162K | $275K |
| **Year 3 revenue** | $81K | $275K | $486K |
| **3-Year cumulative revenue** | $204K | $638K | $1.04M |
| **3-Year net** | **+$204K** | **+$638K** | **+$1.04M** |

**But Option B as proposed has a structural problem:** 18-month exclusivity with a Series A fintech burning cash before a Series B. If PixFlow fails or pivots, Yuno faces:
- Immediate service disruption for merchants
- Forced build under pressure (worse terms, rushed execution)
- Reputational risk with gaming merchants after a disruption event

### 2.4 Breakeven Volume for Option A

For Option A to break even in 3 years at 0.15% take rate:
- Total cost: $320K + (3 × $40K) = $440K
- Annual revenue needed: $146.7K/year
- Required volume: **$97.8M/year**

Yuno's relevant Brazil TPV is $340M. This breakeven requires PIX Parcelado to capture ~29% of that book — achievable in a high-adoption scenario by year 2–3, but speculative today.

**Key threshold:** PIX Parcelado at roughly **$60–70M annual Yuno volume** is where Option A and Option B converge in economics over 3 years (accounting for Option B's higher effective take rate vs. Option A's sunk cost).

## 3. The Three Critical Uncertainties

### Uncertainty 1: Regulatory Outcome (May 2025)

The Central Bank's proposed interest rate cap is the single highest-impact variable. Two outcomes:

**If regulations pass (strict caps):**
- PIX Parcelado becomes less profitable for fintechs → providers exit or reduce product → adoption stalls
- This is a strong argument **against** spending $320K to build native integration
- Under this scenario, Option B is clearly superior: zero sunk cost, Yuno shares limited downside

**If regulations are mild or delayed:**
- PIX Parcelado market expands as projected (420% growth trajectory continues)
- Build investment becomes increasingly justified
- PixFlow's economics remain attractive

**Weight and implication:** We do not know the outcome. The decision needs to be *hedged* against both scenarios. Option A is a directional bet that regulation will be favorable. Option B defers the risk.

**What this means for timing:** The May 2025 regulatory decision should be a formal trigger point in the recommendation. Any strategy should include: "If regulations are restrictive in May, halt build investment and extend or renegotiate the partnership."

### Uncertainty 2: PixFlow's Business Viability

PixFlow's characteristics raise serious continuity risk:
- Series A, $12M raised, burning cash
- Series B expected Q3 2025 — same quarter as potential regulatory disruption
- Investors motivated to show "platform partnership" for valuation, not necessarily for long-term Yuno alignment

**Failure probability assessment:** Venture Series B success rate in Latin America fintech (2024–2025) is approximately 40–50% in favorable conditions. With regulatory risk over the same period, failure probability for PixFlow is meaningfully elevated — possibly 30–40%.

**Expected cost of PixFlow failure (on Option B as proposed):**
- If PixFlow fails in month 12: Yuno has 6 months of partnership revenue, then forced to build anyway (another $320K, now under pressure)
- Disruption risk to gaming merchants during transition
- Expected cost of this scenario: $320K rebuild × 35% probability = **$112K expected cost**

This is why the exclusivity clause is dangerous. It creates a single point of failure.

### Uncertainty 3: PIX Parcelado Market Trajectory

The growth data is real (420% volume growth in 2024) but from a small base. The cautionary signals are also real: major e-commerce merchants show zero interest; the product requires consumers to have separate fintech relationships.

**The adoption S-curve question:** Is PIX Parcelado at the beginning of an S-curve (mainstream incoming) or is it a vertical-specific niche that never breaks out of gaming/travel?

Evidence for mainstream: Brazil's parcelamento culture is deeply embedded; PIX infrastructure is already universal. PIX Parcelado is a natural evolution.

Evidence for niche: B2C fintech relationship friction is high; Central Bank regulation signals concern about consumer credit risk; B2B SaaS and food delivery (60%+ of Yuno's Brazil book) have no use case.

**Yuno's actual exposure:** Even if PIX Parcelado remains vertical-specific, the $340M relevant TPV is large enough to justify investment — IF adoption exceeds $60–70M (the Option A breakeven volume).

## 4. Recommendation: Option C — Modified Partnership with Staged Build Decision

### What this looks like:

**Immediate action (weeks 1–2):** Engage PixFlow in partnership negotiations, but with revised terms:

1. **Reduce exclusivity from 18 to 12 months** — or include a "right to build" carve-out after month 12 that allows Yuno to launch native integration without penalty
2. **Include minimum performance guarantees from PixFlow** — volume SLAs, uptime requirements, and cure periods; if PixFlow fails to meet them, exclusivity is voided
3. **Data rights** — Yuno retains full transaction-level data on PIX Parcelado volume from its merchants (this is critical for the month-12 build decision)
4. **Key-person and M&A protection** — if PixFlow is acquired, Yuno has the right to terminate the exclusivity clause

**Month 6 milestone:** With 6 months of real adoption data:
- Review PIX Parcelado volume growth rate across Yuno Brazil merchants
- Assess PixFlow operational stability (Series B outcome likely known by then)
- Assess regulatory environment (May 2025 decision digested)
- Formal go/no-go decision on initiating native build

**Month 12 decision point (if building):** If data supports native build, begin engineering while still operating under PixFlow partnership. Launch native capability at month 18 (after partnership period ends or via right-to-build clause).

### Why this is better than either original option:

| | Option A (Build) | Option B (Partner) | Option C (Modified) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Time to merchant retention | 6 months | 6–8 weeks | 6–8 weeks |
| Upfront capital risk | $320K | $0 | $0 |
| Regulatory hedge | None | Full | Full (through month 12) |
| PixFlow failure exposure | None | High | Mitigated via terms |
| Optionality to build | N/A | None (exclusivity) | Preserved post-month 12 |
| Revenue during validation | Foregone | Earned | Earned |
| Market learning | Low (no real data pre-build) | High | High |

### The key concession Yuno must make:

PixFlow's leverage is that Yuno needs them more urgently than they need Yuno. Yuno should acknowledge this and offer something in return for better terms: **extended co-marketing commitments, joint case studies, and a clear signal that Yuno will promote PixFlow as a preferred partner to its broader Brazil merchant base** — which gives PixFlow the "platform partnership" narrative they need for their Series B, without requiring Yuno to cede full exclusivity.

## 5. What Would Change This Recommendation

| Assumption | Current View | If Wrong, Recommendation Changes To... |
|---|---|---|
| PixFlow survives and executes well | 60–65% probability | If PixFlow fails → Immediately shift to Option A (build) |
| Regulations are moderate (not restrictive) | 55% probability favorable | If strict caps → Extend partnership indefinitely, do not build |
| Gaming merchants won't leave in 12 months | 60% probability they'll wait | If 1 merchant churns immediately → Accelerate build, accept 6-month gap |
| PIX Parcelado reaches $60M+ Yuno volume in 3 years | Mid scenario | If stuck at Low scenario → Partnership-only, never build |
| PixFlow accepts revised exclusivity terms | Negotiable | If they refuse → Evaluate alternative PIX Parcelado providers before defaulting to PixFlow |

---

## 6. Immediate Next Steps

1. **This week:** Have a direct retention conversation with each of the three gaming merchants. Understand their actual churn timeline — "evaluating a competitor" and "switching in 30 days" require different urgency levels.

2. **This week:** Instruct legal and partnerships team to prepare a revised PixFlow term sheet focused on: exclusivity duration, right-to-build carve-out, data rights, and performance SLAs.

3. **Month 1:** Initiate PixFlow integration while negotiations proceed. The 6–8 week technical timeline means merchants can have the feature by end of Q1.

4. **Month 6:** Formal build/no-build review meeting with clear criteria: (a) regulatory outcome, (b) PixFlow stability, (c) observed adoption volume vs. $60M threshold.

5. **May 2025:** Monitor and formally assess Central Bank regulatory decision. This is the most important external event for this decision.
