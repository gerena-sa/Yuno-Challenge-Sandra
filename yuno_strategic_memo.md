# Strategic Memo: PIX Parcelado — Build vs. Partner Decision
**To:** CEO, Yuno
**From:** Strategy Analyst
**Date:** February 2025
**Subject:** PIX Parcelado — Build, Partner with PixFlow, or a Third Path?

---

## Recommendation

**Partner with PixFlow — but on renegotiated terms — and make a formal build decision at month 12.**

Do not build today. Do not accept PixFlow's terms as proposed. Take PIX Parcelado to market in 6–8 weeks via a modified partnership, generate 12 months of real adoption data, then decide whether to build native integration from a position of evidence rather than speculation.

The financial case for building immediately is weak. The financial case for doing nothing is worse — the three gaming merchants represent **$270K/year in existing Yuno fees that are actively at risk**, not a speculative future opportunity. This is the correct frame for the decision.

---

## The Three Variables That Drive This Decision

Everything else in this memo is detail. These three variables determine the right answer:

**1. PIX Parcelado adoption rate** — Will this reach $75M+ in annual Yuno-processed volume within 3 years, or stay below $25M? This threshold determines whether the $320K build investment ever earns a return. At current signals, the range of outcomes is genuinely wide.

**2. Regulatory outcome (Brazil Central Bank, decision expected May 2025)** — A strict interest rate cap on PIX-based credit products would reduce fintech margin, shrink the number of viable providers, and potentially stall adoption. This single decision could make PIX Parcelado a structurally challenged product — or confirm it as a growth category.

**3. PixFlow's business viability** — A Series A company burning cash toward a Series B in the same quarter as the regulatory decision. If PixFlow fails mid-partnership under the proposed terms, Yuno faces service disruption and a forced emergency build. The 18-month exclusivity clause converts PixFlow's business risk into Yuno's operational risk.

The right strategy hedges against the uncertain outcomes of variables 2 and 3 while using the next 12 months to resolve variable 1.

## Financial Analysis

### Scenario Framework

Three scenarios for PIX Parcelado volume Yuno processes, measured in the first full year after launch:

| Scenario | Description | Y1 Volume | Y2 Volume | Y3 Volume | YoY Growth |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Low** | 3 gaming merchants only; regulation limits growth | $19M | $21.9M | $25M | 15% |
| **Mid** | Gaming + travel merchants; PIX Parcelado matures steadily | $50M | $65M | $84.5M | 30% |
| **High** | Broad adoption across relevant verticals ($340M book) | $85M | $119M | $166.6M | 40% |

*Assumptions: (1) Year 1 = 12 months after launch — for Option A this starts at month 6 post-decision; for Option B at week 6–8. (2) "Relevant verticals" = gaming, travel, electronics = $340M of Yuno's $890M Brazil TPV. (3) Volumes reflect realistic share of credit card volume shifting to PIX Parcelado, consistent with the 15–25% shift estimate given by merchants.*

---

### Option A: Build Native Integration

**Total cost: $320K upfront + $40K/year maintenance = $440K over 3 years**
**Yuno take rate: 0.15%**

| | Low | Mid | High |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Year 1 revenue** | $28.5K | $75K | $127.5K |
| **Year 2 revenue** | $32.8K | $97.5K | $178.5K |
| **Year 3 revenue** | $37.7K | $127.5K | $250K |
| **3-Year cumulative revenue** | $99K | $300K | $556K |
| **3-Year total cost** | $440K | $440K | $440K |
| **3-Year net** | **-$341K** | **-$140K** | **+$116K** |
| **Payback period** | >15 years (not viable) | ~4 years | ~2.5 years |

*Note: Option A does not generate revenue until month 6 (build timeline). Option B generates revenue from week 6–8, giving it approximately 5 additional months of revenue in Year 1 — not modeled here but directionally favorable to Option B.*

---

### Option B: Partner with PixFlow (as proposed)

**Cost: ~$0 upfront**
**Effective Yuno take rate: 18% × 1.8% = 0.324%** (Yuno earns 18% of PixFlow's 1.8% merchant fee)

| | Low | Mid | High |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Year 1 revenue** | $61.6K | $162K | $275K |
| **Year 2 revenue** | $70.8K | $210.6K | $385.6K |
| **Year 3 revenue** | $81K | $275K | $540K |
| **3-Year cumulative revenue** | $213K | $648K | $1.20M |
| **3-Year net** | **+$213K** | **+$648K** | **+$1.20M** |

Option B generates more revenue than Option A across every scenario and every time horizon modeled. Its higher effective take rate (0.324% vs. 0.15%) more than compensates for the absence of a build investment. **On a pure revenue basis, partnering with PixFlow dominates building — in all three scenarios.**

The reason not to simply accept Option B as proposed is not the revenue math. It is the **structural risk** of the exclusivity clause (addressed below).

---

### Breakeven Analysis for Option A

For Option A to recover its $440K 3-year cost, Yuno needs approximately:
- **$75–98M in annual PIX Parcelado volume**, depending on growth rate
  - At flat volume: $440K / (3 years × 0.15%) = $97.8M/year required
  - At 30% YoY growth: breakeven starting volume ≈ $73.5M/year

Today, Yuno's best estimate for the three requesting merchants is $14–24M/year. This is far below the breakeven threshold. **Option A only becomes financially justified if PIX Parcelado reaches the High scenario** — broad adoption across Yuno's relevant Brazil book — which cannot be confirmed from current data.

---

### The Retention Value Framing

The standard analysis misses the most important number: the three gaming merchants generate **$270K/year in existing Yuno fees** ($180M × 0.15%). One is already in a technical evaluation with OrchestraPay.

Estimated expected loss from inaction:
- Assume 40% probability of losing one merchant (~$90K/year in fees) within 12 months without PIX Parcelado
- Expected annual cost of inaction: $90K × 0.4 = **$36K in Year 1 alone**
- Over 3 years with compounding churn risk: **$120K–$180K in protected revenue at risk**

Both Option B and Option C address this within 6–8 weeks. Option A requires 6 months, exposing Yuno to this churn risk for an additional 5 months.

---

## Strategic Risk Assessment

### Risk 1: Regulatory outcome (highest impact, binary)

The Central Bank's proposed interest rate cap could materially reduce fintech margins on PIX-based credit products. If enacted strictly:
- Fintech providers exit or reduce PIX Parcelado offerings
- Consumer adoption stalls without competitive rates
- PIX Parcelado remains a niche product; Low scenario becomes the ceiling

**If this happens:** Option B (or Option C) is clearly the right call. We avoided a $320K sunk cost in a market that didn't develop. Even if PixFlow fails, the partnership generated revenue with no capital at risk.

**If this does NOT happen:** PIX Parcelado growth trajectory continues. The High scenario becomes plausible. Option A begins to look financially justified. This is the signal to initiate the build decision.

**The May 2025 regulatory decision is the single most important external event.** Any strategy must include a defined response to both outcomes.

---

### Risk 2: PixFlow's business viability (high impact, moderate probability)

PixFlow profile: Series A, $12M raised, burning cash, Series B expected Q3 2025 — the same quarter as the regulatory decision.

Estimated failure probability: 30–40% over 18 months, elevated by simultaneous regulatory and fundraising risk.

**If PixFlow fails under Option B as proposed:**
- Service disruption to gaming merchants
- Yuno forced to build under pressure (rushed timeline, worse vendor terms)
- Reputational damage with merchants who just had a disruption
- Expected cost: $320K rebuild × 35% probability = **$112K expected unplanned cost**

This is why the 18-month exclusivity clause is unacceptable as written. It converts PixFlow's financial risk into Yuno's operational risk with no contractual protection.

---

### Risk 3: PIX Parcelado market trajectory (highest uncertainty, affects build ROI)

The 420% volume growth in 2024 is real but from a small base (~$180M to ~$940M quarterly). The cautionary signals are also real: major Brazilian e-commerce merchants show no interest; the product requires consumers to maintain relationships with separate fintechs.

The 60%+ of Yuno's Brazil TPV in SaaS, digital services, and food delivery has essentially no PIX Parcelado use case. The product's relevance is limited to $340M of the $890M portfolio. Even within that $340M, gaming's appetite is clearer than travel or electronics.

**Verdict:** PIX Parcelado is likely to become significant in specific verticals (gaming, travel) but unlikely to become a universal payment method across Yuno's Brazil book. The Low and Mid scenarios are more probable than the High scenario in a 3-year horizon. This makes the Option A build case weaker today — but the right answer in 12 months may be different.

---

### What Additional Information Would Change This Recommendation

The recommendation to partner (not build) is sensitive to these specific information gaps:

1. **The May 2025 regulatory decision** — If BCB confirms no rate cap before May, the High scenario becomes more credible and the build decision should be initiated earlier. *Action: Monitor BCB announcements; formal decision review upon publication.*

2. **PixFlow's actual runway and fundraising status** — If due diligence reveals PixFlow has 18+ months of runway regardless of Series B outcome, the partnership risk is lower than modeled. If runway is under 12 months, the partnership terms must include explicit failure protections. *Action: Request financial disclosure as part of partnership negotiation.*

3. **Actual churn intent of the three gaming merchants** — "Evaluating a competitor" could mean 30-day switching intent or a defensive negotiation tactic. The expected loss calculation changes significantly at different churn probabilities. *Action: Direct conversation with each merchant this week to understand actual timeline and decision drivers.*

4. **Whether alternative PIX Parcelado providers exist** — If there are 2–3 viable providers (not just PixFlow), the exclusivity clause is clearly unacceptable and Yuno has negotiating leverage. If PixFlow is the only viable option today, leverage is limited. *Action: Market scan of Brazilian PIX Parcelado providers before entering negotiations.*

---

## Recommendation: Option C in Practice

### Proposed structure

**This week:** Open PixFlow negotiations. Communicate the intent to partner but flag the exclusivity clause as a blocker. The proposed leverage: Yuno will co-market PixFlow to its full Brazilian merchant base (a "platform partnership" narrative useful for PixFlow's Series B) in exchange for:
1. Exclusivity reduced from 18 to 12 months (or a right-to-build carve-out after month 12)
2. Performance SLAs with cure periods — if PixFlow breaches SLAs, exclusivity is voided
3. M&A protection — if PixFlow is acquired, Yuno may terminate exclusivity
4. Full transaction-level data rights on PIX Parcelado volume from Yuno merchants

**Month 1:** Begin integration in parallel with negotiations. 6–8 week timeline to merchant launch.

**Month 6 review:** With 6 months of live data, assess: (a) regulatory trajectory, (b) PixFlow stability, (c) actual adoption volume vs. $73–98M threshold. First go/no-go signal for a native build.

**Month 12 decision gate:** Formal build/no-build decision with 12 months of real market data, a known regulatory environment, and PixFlow's Series B outcome visible. If building, engineering begins immediately and launches by month 18.

### Why not just build now?

Two reasons. First, the financial math does not support it today: building requires the High scenario to ever see a return, and the probability of the High scenario is lower than the probability of the Low or Mid scenario. Second, the May 2025 regulatory decision is a $320K risk factor that can be resolved in three months. There is no strategic advantage to spending $320K before that decision is known.

### Why not accept Option B as proposed?

The 18-month exclusivity clause with no performance protections creates a scenario where PixFlow's failure becomes Yuno's emergency. The expected cost of that failure scenario ($112K in forced rebuild + disruption) is high enough to require contract protections, especially when PixFlow's motivation to accept revised terms is clear: they need this partnership for their Series B narrative.

---

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **This week — Merchant conversations:** Direct meeting with each of the three gaming merchants to determine actual churn timeline. "Evaluating OrchestraPay" and "switching in 60 days" require different urgency levels. This data directly calibrates the churn risk estimate.

2. **This week — PixFlow term sheet:** Legal and partnerships team drafts a revised PixFlow term sheet with: 12-month exclusivity (or right-to-build after month 12), SLAs, data rights, and M&A protection clause.

3. **Week 2–6 — Integration:** Begin technical integration with PixFlow. Merchant go-live target: end of March 2025.

4. **Month 6 — Formal review:** Adoption volume vs. threshold, regulatory environment, PixFlow stability. First go/no-go input for the build decision.

5. **May 2025 — Regulatory trigger:** Upon BCB regulatory decision, formal strategy review. If strict caps: extend partnership, do not build. If favorable: initiate build evaluation with 6 months of adoption data in hand.
